# Travel-App Project

## Overview
This project requires building a travel application that, at a minimum, obtains the desired location and date of travel from the user, and displays the weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

## Instructions
This project aims to give you the opportunity to put all the skills you have learned into one project to create your own custom travel app. Due to the nature of this course, JavaScript is very heavy, but you are still expected to create clean and attractive HTML/CSS. You will also focus on the DOM, working with objects and retrieving data from 3 APIs where one API depends on another to function. Ultimately, all of this will be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server and wrapped with service workers.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
